Interpreter
===========

The Java projects which implements the interpreter for the simple language.
The implementation is based on ANTLR library. This library is a powerful parser generator for reading and processing any text formats. From the grammar file, it generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.
The grammar file defines the syntax rules for the interpreted language.

The grammar file is - [Expr.g4](https://github.com/miklen326/interpreter/blob/master/src/main/java/com/interpreter/parsers/Expr.g4)
Application entry point - [App.java](https://github.com/miklen326/interpreter/blob/master/src/main/java/com/interpreter/App.java)
